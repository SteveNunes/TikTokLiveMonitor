# TikTokLiveMonitor
A cool TikTok monitor that you can use for monitor basically
all live events in real time. The most cool thing on it is:
You can configure the coin value and so it will show you how
much money the user are earning from all received gifts since
the monitor is opened. It even save the current state of received
gifts and chat story, so if you close the program, everything
will be recovered when you open it again.
